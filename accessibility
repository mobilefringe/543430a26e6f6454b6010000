<h5>Everyone is welcome at Halifax Shopping Centre.&nbsp;</h5>
<p>We recognize that while our programs provide a useful service to&nbsp;many of our visitors,&nbsp;they&nbsp;may not&nbsp;meet&nbsp;the needs of all of our visitors&nbsp;as many&nbsp;may&nbsp;have specific requirements. Whenever it is safe to do so,&nbsp;any visitor who&nbsp;requires a piece of equipment, or service animal, to accommodate a disability may bring their equipment or animal to Halifax Shopping Centre with them.</p>
<p>When purchasing our equipment for our courtesy programs, our policy&nbsp;is to consult with groups representing Nova Scotians with accessibility&nbsp;needs. Our Customer Service&nbsp;desk amenities are part&nbsp;of a commitment to&nbsp;making Halifax Shopping Centre a safe and comfortable place to visit.&nbsp;This commitment includes handicap and family parking at each entrance,&nbsp;family &amp; handicap washrooms located on both levels, and trained emergency responders onsite.</p>
<p>We are continuously making strides to&nbsp;improve. If you have concerns or questions about&nbsp;our accessiblity, or the&nbsp;equipment available&nbsp;from our Customer&nbsp;Service&nbsp;desk, we&nbsp;encourage you to&nbsp;contact us at <a href="mailto:hfxcustomerservice@20vic.com">hfxcustomerservice@20vic.com</a> or by contact our Customer Service&nbsp;desk at&nbsp;902-453-1752.</p>
