            <h5>Idle Free</h5>
            <p>We are commited to the health of our planet and community by encouraging our customers to turn off their engines!</p>
            <p>If all Canadians reduced thier idle time for only 3 minutes a day it would reduce greenhouse gas emmissions by 1.6 million tonnes a year! Greenhouse gases are harmful to the environment, our health and affect climate change.</p>
            <p>How can you help? If you will be stopped for more then 30 seconds turn off your engine!</p>
            <p>Your community and planet will thank you!</p>
